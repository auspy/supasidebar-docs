# Sidebar Stays on Top When Switching Apps

## Problem

The sidebar floats above all windows by default. When you switch from your browser to another app (e.g., a text editor), the browser goes behind as expected, but the sidebar remains visible on top, blocking your view.

## Solution

Enable **Auto-show with Browser** to automatically hide the sidebar when you switch to a non-browser app and show it again when you return to your browser.

### Setup

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Enable **Auto-show with Browser**

The sidebar will now only appear when a browser is your active app. Switching to any other application will automatically hide it.
