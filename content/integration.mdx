# Browser and Finder Integration

These shortcuts capture information from your active browser tab or Finder window and send it to SupaSidebar. Follow the step-by-step instructions below to use each shortcut.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Install SupaSidebar and open the app at least once.  
2. Ensure SupaSidebar has the necessary macOS permissions:
   - Accessibility (for global shortcuts)
   - Full Disk Access or Files & Folders access (if required for Finder integration)

## Smart Save  (`Cmd + Shift + S`)

**What it does:**  
Saves the current browser page (or selected files in Finder) to SupaSidebar.

**How to perform (browser):**

1. Focus the browser window and make sure the tab you want to save is active.  
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + S`.  
3. SupaSidebar will capture the active tab’s title and URL and create a new item in the sidebar.  
4. Optionally, open SupaSidebar and move the saved item into a Space or add tags/notes.

**How to perform (Finder):**

1. In Finder, select one or more files you want to add.  
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + S`.  
3. SupaSidebar will import the selected files and store references in the sidebar.  
4. Open SupaSidebar to organize imported items into Spaces or mark as Favorites.

**Notes and tips:**

- If no browser tab or file is detected, SupaSidebar may show a notification indicating nothing was captured.  
- When saving web pages, the saved item typically includes page title, URL, and any page metadata the extension provides.

## Smart Copy  (`Ctrl + Cmd + C`)

**What it does:**  
Copies the current browser tab’s URL (or a selected file path in Finder) to the clipboard and optionally saves a reference to SupaSidebar depending on settings.

**How to perform (browser):**

1. Focus the browser window and make sure the tab you want to copy is active.  
2. Press `Ctrl + Cmd + C`.  
3. The page URL is copied to the clipboard. You can now paste it anywhere (editor, chat, document).  
4. If SupaSidebar is configured to also create a quick reference, check the sidebar to see the copied item.

**How to perform (Finder):**

1. Select a file in Finder.  
2. Press `Ctrl + Cmd + C`.  
3. The selected file’s full path is copied to the clipboard. Paste the path where needed.  
4. If your settings create a reference in SupaSidebar, verify the sidebar for the new entry.

**Notes and tips:**

- `Ctrl + Cmd + C` is especially useful when you need to share or log a URL or file path quickly without opening the sidebar.  
- If the clipboard is not updated, test copying manually (Cmd + C) to confirm keyboard behavior and check for conflicting global shortcuts.

## Add Current Folder  (`Cmd + Option + A`)

**What it does:**  
Adds the currently visible Finder folder to SupaSidebar. This ignores any file selection and captures the folder itself.

**How to perform:**

1. Open Finder and navigate to the folder you want to add (the folder should be the active Finder window or the active path in a Finder tab).  
2. Ensure no other app has focus; Finder must be the active application.  
3. Press `Cmd + Option + A`.  
4. SupaSidebar will add the current folder as an item in the sidebar (you can then place it into a Space or favorite it).

**Notes and tips:**

- This shortcut captures the folder currently shown in Finder’s active window, not the folder that contains a selected file.  
- If Finder is in column or list view, confirm the path at the top of the window before using the shortcut.

## Troubleshooting

- **Shortcuts do nothing:**  
  - Confirm SupaSidebar is running and has Accessibility permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).  
  - Verify the shortcuts are enabled in SupaSidebar settings and not overridden by another app (e.g., a third-party clipboard manager).  
  - Try relaunching SupaSidebar and the browser or Finder.

- **Browser tab not captured or URL not copied:**  
  - Make sure the browser extension (if required) is installed and enabled.  
  - Check that the active tab is not a special page (browser internal pages sometimes block extensions).

- **File paths not copied correctly:**  
  - Ensure Finder has proper permissions if macOS blocks access to file paths.  
  - Try selecting the file and using `Cmd + Option + C` (system copy) to confirm Finder selection behavior.

- **Shortcut conflicts:**  
  - If a shortcut conflicts with another global shortcut, change it in SupaSidebar → Settings → Shortcuts to an available combination.

## Additional Configuration

- Open **SupaSidebar → Settings → Shortcuts** to customize key combinations.  
- In Settings, you may also enable options such as automatically creating a saved item on Smart Copy or prompting for tags/spaces after Smart Save.  
- Review the Support or FAQ section in SupaSidebar if you need details about browser extension installation or macOS permission prompts.
