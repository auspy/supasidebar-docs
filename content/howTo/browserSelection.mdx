# Browser Selection

Choose which browser opens your links - pick on demand, assign per link, or use your active browser.

## Ways to Select a Browser

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| Right-click | Right-click link → **Open With** → choose browser |
| `Opt` click | Hold `Opt` and click a link |
| `Opt Return` | Select link in Command Panel, press `Opt Return` |
| Air Traffic Control | Set URL-based routing rules in **Preferences → Air Traffic Control**. See [Air Traffic Control](/features/airTrafficControl) |

Default: Links open in their assigned browser, or system default if none assigned. Explicit choices (`Opt`-click, right-click picker) always override ATC rules.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Opt` click | Show browser picker |
| `Opt Return` | Show browser picker (Command Panel) |
| `↑` `↓` | Navigate picker |
| `Return` | Select browser |
| `Escape` | Cancel |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Browser not in picker | Install in Applications folder, restart app |
| Wrong browser opens | Right-click link → Set Browser → choose correct one |
| Picker doesn't appear | Hold `Opt` while clicking/pressing Return |
| Assignment not saving | Use "Set Browser" (right-click), not one-time `Opt` click |
