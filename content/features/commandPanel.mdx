# Command Panel

Lightning-fast search and command palette for instant navigation across all your saved links, folders, and the web - all without touching your mouse.


## How It Works


![Fuzzy match](/assets/fuzzy%20match.jpeg)

The Command Panel is a keyboard-driven interface that appears instantly with **⌘⌃K**. Start typing and results appear in real-time, powered by fuzzy search that finds matches even with typos or partial words.

### What You Can Search

- **Saved Links** - Search across all your saved websites, files, and folders by title or URL
- **Recent Items** - Access recently visited browser pages you haven't saved yet
- **Live Browser Tabs** - See and switch to currently open tabs across all supported browsers
- **Web Search** - Type any query and search directly with your preferred search engine (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.)

### Fuzzy Search 

The search engine is forgiving and intelligent:
- **Typo-tolerant**: "fecebook" finds "Facebook"
- **Acronyms**: "gh" finds "GitHub"
- **Partial matches**: "sup doc" finds "SupaSidebar Documentation"
- **URL matching**: Search by domain or full URL
