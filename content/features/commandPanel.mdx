# Command Panel

Lightning-fast search and command palette for instant navigation across all your saved links, folders, and the web - all without touching your mouse.

</p>

The Command Panel is a keyboard-driven interface that appears instantly with **⌘⌃K**. Start typing and results appear in real-time, powered by fuzzy search that finds matches even with typos or partial words.

### What You Can Search

- **Saved Links** - Search across all your saved websites, files, and folders by title or URL
- **Recent Items** - Access recently visited browser pages you haven't saved yet
- **Live Browser Tabs** - See and switch to currently open tabs across all supported browsers
- **Web Search** - Type any query and search directly with your preferred search engine (Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.)

### Fuzzy Search 

The search engine is forgiving and intelligent:
- **Typo-tolerant**: "fecebook" finds "Facebook"
- **Acronyms**: "gh" finds "GitHub"
- **Partial matches**: "sup doc" finds "SupaSidebar Documentation"
- **URL matching**: Search by domain or full URL

## Tips & Tricks

### Instant Link Creation
Found a useful page? Press **⌘⌃K** → **⌘V** to paste the URL and create a link without leaving your keyboard.

### Cross-Workspace Search
The command panel searches across *all* spaces, making it perfect for finding links when you can't remember which workspace they're in.

### Recent Items as Temporary Bookmarks
Don't clutter your saved links with one-time research. The command panel surfaces recent items automatically - save only what you'll revisit.

### Live Tab Switching
Press **⌘⌃K** and search for an open tab by title. Press Return to switch to that tab instantly - faster than ⌘Tab through apps.

### Search Ranking
Results are ranked by:
1. Exact title matches
2. URL matches
3. Fuzzy title matches
4. Fuzzy URL matches

Most relevant items always appear first.
