The Sidebar Panel is a floating window that sits on the edge of your screen, ready to appear with a single keystroke. It organizes all your saved content in an easy-to-navigate interface with folders, search, and quick actions.

### Key Features

The sidebar intelligently positions itself on whichever screen you're currently using, automatically adjusting when you move between displays.

- Place the sidebar on the **left** or **right** side of your screen
- Toggle between sides instantly with a keyboard shortcut
- Sidebar remembers your preference for each screen

**Smart Behavior**
- **Auto-hide**: Sidebar can automatically hide when you click outside of it
- **Opacity adjustment**: Reduce visual distraction when the sidebar loses focus
- **Pin to spaces**: Make the sidebar follow you across all macOS desktop spaces, or keep it anchored to specific workspaces

**Resizable & Draggable**
Customize the sidebar to fit your workflow:
- Drag to resize the panel width
- Reposition anywhere along the screen edge
- Settings persist across app restarts

## Setup

The sidebar works out of the box with default settings. To customize:

1. Open **Preferences** (click gear icon in sidebar)
2. Navigate to **General** tab
3. Adjust these options:
   - **Auto-hide on deactivate**: Hide sidebar when clicking outside
   - **Opacity on focus change**: Reduce opacity when not focused
   - **Sidebar side**: Choose left or right side (or use ⌘⌃L shortcut)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⇧Space** | Toggle sidebar visibility |
| **⌘⌃F** | Focus sidebar (bring to front) |
| **⌘⌃L** | Toggle between left and right sides |
| **⌘⌃P** | Pin/unpin sidebar to follow active space |

## Tips & Tricks

### Pin Across All Spaces
By default, the sidebar stays on the current macOS space. Press **⌘⌃P** to make it follow you everywhere - perfect for quick-access workflows.

### Multi-Monitor Setup
The sidebar automatically positions itself on your active screen. When you move to a different display, press **⌘⇧Space** twice (hide then show) to reposition it to the new screen.

### Reduce Distraction
Enable **opacity on focus change** in preferences to make the sidebar semi-transparent when not in use, reducing visual clutter while keeping it accessible.

### Quick Navigation Workflow
1. Press **⌘⇧Space** to show sidebar
2. Navigate with arrow keys or type to search
3. Press **Return** to open item
4. Sidebar auto-hides, keeping you in flow
