# Spaces

Organize your digital life into separate workspaces - one for work, one for personal projects, one for learning. Switch between them instantly with keyboard shortcuts.

**Note:** Spaces is a **Premium feature**. Free users can use 1 space. [Upgrade](https://supasidebar.com/pricing) for unlimited spaces.


## How It Works

Each Space is an in dependent workspace containing its own set of:
- Saved links and folders
- Smart folders
- Recent items (optional)
- Live browser tabs (filtered by space)

Think of Spaces like virtual desktops for your sidebar - completely separate environments that you can switch between instantly.

## Setup

### Creating Spaces

1. Click the **space selector** at the top of the sidebar
2. Click **+ New Space**
3. Name your space (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Writing")
4. Optionally set a color for visual distinction

### Setting Default Startup Space

Choose which space opens when you launch SupaSidebar:

1. Open **Preferences → Spaces**
2. Select your preferred **Default startup space**
3. SupaSidebar will always open to this space

## Using Spaces

### Adding Links to Spaces

When you save a link (⌘⌃S), it's automatically added to your **current space**.
To move links between spaces:
1. Right-click the link
2. Select **Move to Space**
3. Choose destination space

### Organizing Within Spaces

Each space has its own:
- **Folders**: Create hierarchical organization
- **Smart Folders**: Auto-organize with rules
- **Pinned Items**: Quick-access favorites (shared across all spaces)

## Advanced Features

### Space Navigation Shortcuts

Enable keyboard shortcuts for instant space switching:

1. Open **Preferences → Spaces**
2. Enable **Space navigation**
3. Optionally enable **Number shortcuts** (⌘⌃1-9)

This lets you jump directly to specific spaces without cycling.


## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃←** | Previous space (cyclic) |
| **⌘⌃→** | Next space (cyclic) |
| **⌘⌃1** - **⌘⌃9** | Jump to space 1-9 (if enabled) |
