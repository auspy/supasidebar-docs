# Spaces

Organize your digital life into separate workspaces - one for work, one for personal projects, one for learning. Switch between them instantly with keyboard shortcuts.

**Note:** Spaces is a **Premium feature**. Free users can use 1 space. [Upgrade](https://supasidebar.com/pricing) for unlimited spaces.

## When to Use

- Separate work links from personal browsing
- Organize different projects into dedicated workspaces
- Keep client work isolated and confidential
- Create context-specific environments (Research, Writing, Design, etc.)
- Reduce cognitive load by showing only relevant links for your current task

## How It Works

Each Space is an independent workspace containing its own set of:
- Saved links and folders
- Smart folders
- Recent items (optional)
- Live browser tabs (filtered by space)

Think of Spaces like virtual desktops for your sidebar - completely separate environments that you can switch between instantly.

### Space-Based Organization

**Example Workflow:**

**Work Space**: Company tools, client websites, project documentation
**Personal Space**: Social media, shopping sites, hobbies
**Learning Space**: Courses, tutorials, research papers

## Using Spaces

### Switching Spaces

### Adding Links to Spaces

When you save a link (⌘⌃S), it's automatically added to your **current space**.

To move links between spaces:
1. Right-click the link
2. Select **Move to Space**
3. Choose destination space

### Organizing Within Spaces

Each space has its own:
- **Folders**: Create hierarchical organization
- **Smart Folders**: Auto-organize with rules
- **Pinned Items**: Quick-access favorites (shared across all spaces)

## Advanced Features

### Space Navigation Shortcuts

Enable keyboard shortcuts for instant space switching:

1. Open **Preferences → Spaces**
2. Enable **Space navigation**
3. Optionally enable **Number shortcuts** (⌘⌃1-9)

This lets you jump directly to specific spaces without cycling.

### Browser Tab Management (BETA)

**Premium Feature**: Automatically save and restore browser tabs when switching spaces.

1. Open **Preferences → Spaces**
2. Enable **Save tabs on space switch**
3. When you switch spaces, SupaSidebar:
   - Saves all open browser tabs from the current space
   - Restores previously saved tabs for the new space
   - Optionally force-quits browsers between spaces for clean transitions

**Warning:** This feature is in beta. Tab restoration works best with Safari and Chrome.

### Space Locking (Premium)

Password-protect sensitive spaces:

1. Right-click a space in the selector
2. Select **Lock Space**
3. Set a password
4. The space will require password entry to access

Perfect for client work or personal privacy.

### Live Tabs Filtering

When [Live Tabs](liveTabs) is enabled, you can filter tabs by space:

1. Open **Preferences → Live Tabs**
2. Enable **Filter tabs by current space**
3. Only tabs from websites saved to the current space will appear

Example: In "Work" space, only see work-related tabs.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃←** | Previous space (cyclic) |
| **⌘⌃→** | Next space (cyclic) |
| **⌘⌃1** - **⌘⌃9** | Jump to space 1-9 (if enabled) |

## Tips & Tricks

### Context Switching Made Easy
Create spaces for different work modes:
- **Deep Work**: Development tools, documentation, no distractions
- **Communication**: Email, Slack, project management
- **Research**: Reading list, articles, learning resources

Switch spaces to switch mental contexts.

### Client-Based Organization
Freelancers and consultants can create a space per client, keeping all client-specific resources isolated and organized.

### Temporary Spaces
Create a "Scratch" or "Temporary" space for short-term research or projects. Delete it when done to keep your sidebar clean.

### Space Colors
Assign colors to spaces for quick visual identification:
- Red for urgent/work
- Blue for personal
- Green for learning

### Shared vs. Space-Specific Content

**Shared Across All Spaces:**
- Pinned items (always accessible)
- Global shortcuts

**Space-Specific:**
- Saved links and folders
- Smart folders
- Recent items (optional)
- Live tabs (with filtering)
