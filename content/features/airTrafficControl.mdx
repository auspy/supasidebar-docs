# Air Traffic Control

Automatically route links to the right space and browser based on URL patterns, like mail rules for your bookmarks.

## How It Works

When you open any link, SupaSidebar checks its URL against your routing rules. If a rule matches, the link is automatically:

1. **Saved to the target space** (if configured)
2. **Opened in the target browser** (if configured)

Rules are evaluated top-to-bottom. The **first matching rule wins**. If no rules match, the link opens with your default settings.

> Explicit choices always override ATC. If you use `Opt`-click or the browser picker to choose a specific browser, that choice takes priority over any routing rule.

## Setup

1. Open **Preferences → Air Traffic Control**
2. Toggle **Enable Air Traffic Control**
3. Click **Add Route** to create your first rule

## Creating a Rule

Each rule has four settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **URL Pattern** | The text to match against link URLs |
| **Match Type** | `contains`: URL includes the pattern anywhere. `is equal to`: URL must match exactly |
| **Target Space** | The space to route matching links to (optional) |
| **Target Browser** | The browser to open matching links in, or "Use default" (optional) |

## Managing Rules

- **Reorder** - Drag rules to change priority (first match wins)
- **Enable/Disable** - Toggle individual rules without deleting them
- **Edit** - Click a rule to modify its settings
- **Delete** - Remove rules you no longer need

## Examples

| URL Pattern | Match Type | Target Space | Target Browser | Effect |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| `github.com` | contains | Development | - | All GitHub links go to Dev space |
| `figma.com` | contains | Design | Chrome | Figma links open in Chrome, saved to Design space |
| `docs.google.com` | contains | Work | - | Google Docs go to Work space |
| `localhost` | contains | Development | Safari | Local dev URLs open in Safari |

## Tips

- **Start broad, refine later** - Begin with domain-level patterns like `github.com`, then add specific patterns if needed
- **Use "contains" for most rules** - It's more flexible than exact matching
- **Order matters** - Put more specific rules above general ones
- **Combine with Spaces** - ATC is most useful when you have multiple spaces for different contexts
