# Mouse Triggers

Show the sidebar by simply moving your mouse to the edge of your screen - no clicking, no keyboard shortcuts required.

## When to Use

- Prefer mouse-driven workflows over keyboard shortcuts
- Want quick sidebar access without memorizing shortcuts
- Use a trackpad and find edge gestures natural
- Work with large displays where reaching edges is easy
- Combine with keyboard shortcuts for hybrid access

## How It Works

[PLACEHOLDER: Video showing mouse cursor moving to screen edge and sidebar appearing]

Mouse Triggers turn your screen edges into hot zones. Move your cursor to the configured edge, pause briefly, and the sidebar slides into view automatically.

### Edge-Based Activation

Choose which screen edges trigger the sidebar:
- **Left edge** - Hover near left side of screen
- **Right edge** - Hover near right side of screen
- **Both edges** - Either side works

When you move your cursor away, the sidebar can auto-hide or stay visible.

## Setup

### Enable Mouse Triggers

1. Open **Preferences → Mouse Triggers**
2. Toggle **Enable mouse triggers** ON
3. Select edge zones (left, right, or both)
4. Adjust sensitivity settings (optional)

### Required Permissions

Mouse Triggers require **Accessibility permissions** to detect mouse position:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Find **SupaSidebar** in the list
3. Enable the checkbox

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Accessibility permissions dialog]

**Why Accessibility?**
macOS requires this permission for apps to monitor global mouse position. SupaSidebar only uses it for edge detection - no data collection.

## Customization

### Edge Threshold

Control how close to the edge you need to move:

- **Small (5px)**: Must be very close to edge
- **Medium (10px)**: Moderate trigger zone
- **Large (15px)**: Wide trigger zone, easier to activate

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Edge Threshold**

**Tip**: Use smaller thresholds on large displays, larger on small screens.

### Hover Delay

Set how long to hover before sidebar appears:

- **Fast (0.1s)**: Instant response
- **Medium (0.2s)**: Default, balanced
- **Slow (0.5s)**: Prevents accidental triggers

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Hover Delay**

**Tip**: Increase delay if you accidentally trigger the sidebar when reaching for scroll bars or window edges.

### Edge Zone Selection

Choose which edges are active:

**Left Edge Only**
Good if sidebar is positioned on left side

**Right Edge Only**
Good if sidebar is positioned on right side

**Both Edges**
Maximum flexibility - trigger from either side

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Enabled Zones**

## Advanced Features

### Hysteresis Distance

Prevents flickering when cursor hovers near edge:

Once sidebar appears, you can move slightly away from edge without hiding it. This "dead zone" makes the interaction feel smoother.

**Technical Detail:**
- Trigger distance: User-configured edge threshold
- Deactivate distance: Trigger distance + 10px

Automatically handled - no configuration needed.

### Multi-Screen Support

Mouse triggers work across all connected displays:
- Each screen has independent edge zones
- Triggering shows sidebar on that screen
- Works seamlessly as you move between monitors

### Performance Optimization

Mouse triggers use high-performance CGEventTap:
- Minimal CPU impact
- No polling - event-driven detection
- Instant response times
- Efficient memory usage

## Combining with Other Features

### Mouse + Keyboard Hybrid

Use both access methods:
- **Mouse trigger** when browsing casually
- **⌘⇧Space** when keyboard is already in hand
- **⌘⌃K** for focused search sessions

Different workflows, different access methods.

### Auto-Hide Behavior

Configure sidebar auto-hide in **Preferences → General**:

**With Auto-Hide ON:**
1. Mouse to edge → Sidebar appears
2. Click outside → Sidebar hides
3. Repeat as needed

**With Auto-Hide OFF:**
1. Mouse to edge → Sidebar appears
2. Stays visible until you explicitly hide it (Esc or ⌘⇧Space)

### Sidebar Positioning

Mouse triggers adapt to sidebar position:

**Sidebar on Left:**
- Enable left edge trigger
- Right edge can be used for other apps/features

**Sidebar on Right:**
- Enable right edge trigger
- Left edge available for other purposes

**Sidebar Switches Sides:**
- Enable both edges for maximum flexibility

Toggle sidebar side with **⌘⌃L**

## Tips & Tricks

### Large Display Workflow
On ultra-wide or large displays, mouse triggers are faster than keyboard shortcuts:
- Throw cursor to edge (large movement)
- Sidebar appears instantly
- No keyboard context switch needed

### Trackpad Gestures
Combine with macOS trackpad gestures:
- Three-finger swipe between spaces
- Flick cursor to edge to open sidebar
- Seamless multi-touch workflow

### Prevent Accidental Triggers
If you frequently trigger the sidebar by accident:
1. Increase **Hover Delay** to 0.3-0.5s
2. Decrease **Edge Threshold** to 5px
3. Disable edge on the side you accidentally trigger

### Hybrid Positioning
Place sidebar on left, but enable both edge triggers:
- Left edge for quick access (shorter distance)
- Right edge as backup when left is blocked by windows

### Disable for Focus Work
During focused work sessions:
1. Toggle **Enable mouse triggers** OFF in preferences
2. Use keyboard shortcuts only
3. Re-enable when needed

## Troubleshooting

**Mouse triggers not working?**
- Verify Accessibility permissions are granted
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Enable SupaSidebar
- Restart SupaSidebar after granting permissions

**Sidebar appearing too easily?**
- Increase **Hover Delay** (try 0.3s or 0.5s)
- Decrease **Edge Threshold** (try 5px)
- Disable edge on problem side

**Sidebar not appearing?**
- Check that **Enable mouse triggers** is ON
- Verify at least one edge zone is enabled
- Check cursor is actually reaching the configured threshold distance
- Ensure sidebar isn't already visible

**Sidebar flickering?**
- This should be prevented by hysteresis
- If it persists, increase **Hover Delay**
- Report issue to support

**Multi-monitor issues?**
- Mouse triggers should work on all screens
- Try moving cursor to edge on each display to test
- Ensure macOS isn't blocking the trigger area with Dock or menu bar
