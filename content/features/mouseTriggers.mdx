# Mouse Triggers

Show the sidebar by simply moving your mouse to the edge of your screen - no clicking, no keyboard shortcuts required.

## How It Works

    Mouse Triggers
  </a>
</p>


Mouse Triggers turn your screen edges into hot zones. Move your cursor to the configured edge, pause briefly, and the sidebar slides into view automatically.

### Edge-Based Activation

Choose which screen edges trigger the sidebar:
 Hover near left/right side of screen

When you move your cursor away, the sidebar can auto-hide or stay visible.<br />

Control how close to the edge you need to move:

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Edge Threshold**

Use smaller thresholds on large displays, larger on small screens.

### Hover Delay



Set how long to hover before sidebar appears:

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Hover Delay**

Increase delay if you accidentally trigger the sidebar when reaching for scroll bars or window edges.

### Edge Zone Selection



Choose which edges are active:

**Left Edge Only**
Good if sidebar is positioned on left side

**Right Edge Only**
Good if sidebar is positioned on right side

**Both Edges**
Maximum flexibility - trigger from either side

Set in **Preferences → Mouse Triggers → Enabled Zones**

## Troubleshooting

**Mouse triggers not working?**
- Verify Accessibility permissions are granted
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Enable SupaSidebar
- Restart SupaSidebar after granting permissions

**Sidebar appearing too easily?**
- Increase **Hover Delay** (try 0.3s or 0.5s)
- Decrease **Edge Threshold** (try 5px)
- Disable edge on problem side

**Sidebar not appearing?**
- Check that **Enable mouse triggers** is ON
- Verify at least one edge zone is enabled
- Check cursor is actually reaching the configured threshold distance
- Ensure sidebar isn't already visible

**Sidebar flickering?**
- This should be prevented by hysteresis
- If it persists, increase **Hover Delay**
- Report issue to support

**Multi-monitor issues?**
- Mouse triggers should work on all screens
- Try moving cursor to edge on each display to test
- Ensure macOS isn't blocking the trigger area with Dock or menu bar
