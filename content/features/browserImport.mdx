# Browser Import

Import your existing bookmarks and spaces from Arc Browser or Chrome to get started quickly.

## How It Works

SupaSidebar can read your browser's bookmark data and import it into your sidebar. The import process preserves your folder structure and organization.

### Supported Browsers

| Browser | What Imports |
|---------|-------------|
| **Arc** | Spaces, folders, and bookmarks |
| **Chrome** | Bookmarks and folders |

## Import from Arc

Arc users can bring over their entire workspace organization, including spaces.

### Prerequisites

- Arc Browser installed on your Mac
- SupaSidebar has Automation permission for Arc

### Steps

1. Open **Preferences** → **Import** tab
2. Click **Import from Arc**
3. Grant Automation permission if prompted
4. Select which spaces to import (or import all)
5. Click **Start Import**
6. Wait for the import to complete

### What Gets Imported

- **Spaces**: Each Arc space becomes a SupaSidebar space
- **Folders**: Folder structure is preserved within each space
- **Pinned tabs**: Imported as pinned items
- **Bookmarks**: All bookmarks with their URLs and titles

## Import from Chrome

Bring your Chrome bookmarks into SupaSidebar.

### Prerequisites

- Chrome installed on your Mac
- SupaSidebar has Automation permission for Chrome

### Steps

1. Open **Preferences** → **Import** tab
2. Click **Import from Chrome**
3. Grant Automation permission if prompted
4. Select which bookmark folders to import
5. Click **Start Import**
6. Wait for the import to complete

### What Gets Imported

- **Bookmarks Bar**: Imported to your default space
- **Other Bookmarks**: Imported with folder structure preserved
- **Folders**: All folder hierarchy maintained

## During Import

- A progress indicator shows import status
- Large imports may take a few minutes
- You can continue using SupaSidebar during import
- Imported items appear in the sidebar as they're processed

## After Import

- Review imported items in your sidebar
- Reorganize into spaces and folders as needed
- Delete any unwanted imports
- Set up tags for better organization

## Troubleshooting

**"Browser not found" error**
- Ensure the browser is installed in /Applications
- Restart SupaSidebar and try again

**"Permission denied" error**
1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Automation**
2. Find SupaSidebar in the list
3. Enable the toggle for your browser (Arc or Chrome)
4. Restart SupaSidebar

**Import is incomplete**
- Some bookmarks may fail if URLs are malformed
- Check the import log in Preferences for details
- Manually add any missing items

**Duplicate items after import**
- Running import multiple times creates duplicates
- Delete duplicates manually before re-importing
- Use the import feature only once per browser

**Arc spaces not appearing**
- Ensure Arc is running during import
- Check that spaces have at least one bookmark
- Empty spaces may not import
