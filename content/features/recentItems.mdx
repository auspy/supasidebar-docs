# Recent Items

Automatic tracking of your browsing history across all supported browsers - see recently visited pages without manually saving them.

## When to Use

- **Research review**: Review sites you visited during research without saving everything
- **Quick recovery**: Return to a page you closed accidentally
- **Unified history**: Track browsing history across multiple browsers in one place
- **Temporary access**: Access pages without cluttering saved links
- **Browse patterns**: Discover patterns in your browsing habits

## How It Works

</p>


Recent Items automatically monitors your browsers and tracks pages you visit. No manual saving required - just browse normally and SupaSidebar captures your history.

### Automatic Tracking

SupaSidebar uses two methods to track browser activity:

**Accessibility Observer** (Direct Distribution only)
Real-time tracking using macOS Accessibility API - instant updates when you navigate.

**Polling Mode** (All versions)
Periodic checks every few seconds via AppleScript.

### Multi-Browser Support

Recent Items tracks across all supported browsers simultaneously:
- Safari
- Chrome
- Edge
- Brave
- Vivaldi
- Comet
- Orion
- Atlas (ChatGPT)
- Helium
- Firefox (with keyboard shortcuts enabled)

See [Browser Integration](browserIntegration) for complete list.

1. Open **Preferences → Recents**
2. Ensure mode is set to **Recent Items** (not Live Tabs)
3. Configure display limit (default: 30 items)

</p>


### Required Permissions

Recent Items requires **Automation permissions**:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**
2. Find **SupaSidebar**
3. Enable checkboxes for all browsers you want to track

For real-time tracking (Direct Distribution):
- **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** → Enable SupaSidebar

</p>

### Configure Display Limit

Control how many recent items appear:

1. Open **Preferences → Recents**
2. Set **Display limit** (1-100 items)
3. Default: 30 items

More items = more history, but longer list to scroll through.

## Using Recent Items

### Viewing Recent History

Recent items appear in the sidebar's **Recents** section, showing:
- Page title
- URL
- Browser icon (which browser you used)
- Timestamp (when you visited)

Sorted by most recent first.

### Opening Recent Pages

**From Sidebar:**
1. Navigate to recent item with arrow keys or click
2. Press **Return** or click to open

**From Command Panel:**
1. Press **⌘⌃K**
2. Type part of the page title or URL
3. Recent items appear in search results
4. Press **Return** to open

### Saving Recent Items

Found something useful in your recent history?

1. Right-click the recent item
2. Select **Save to Current Space**
3. Item becomes a permanent saved link

Or simply let it stay as a recent item - it'll remain for 30 days.

### Ignoring Duplicates

If you visit the same page multiple times, Recent Items updates the timestamp instead of creating duplicates. Your list stays clean.

## Recent Items vs. Live Tabs

Choose between two modes in **Preferences → Recents**:

| Feature | Recent Items | Live Tabs |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Shows | Visited pages (30 day history) | Currently open tabs |
| Updates | When you navigate to new page | When tabs open/close/switch |
| Purpose | Historical reference | Real-time tab management |
| Persists after | Browser closes | Only while tab is open |

See [Live Tabs](liveTabs) for details on the alternative mode.

## Automatic Cleanup

Recent items are automatically removed after **30 days** to keep your list relevant. No manual cleanup required.

**Saves vs. Recents:**
- **Saved links**: Never auto-delete, permanent
- **Recent items**: Auto-delete after 30 days

If you want to keep something forever, save it.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Link Names

By default, recent items use the page title from the browser. To customize:

1. Right-click a recent item
2. Select **Rename**
3. Type custom name

The custom name persists even if you revisit the page - SupaSidebar won't overwrite your custom name.

### Firefox Keyboard Shortcuts

Firefox has limited AppleScript support. To enable recent tracking:

1. Open **Preferences → Recents**
2. Enable **Firefox keyboard shortcuts**
3. SupaSidebar will use a workaround method to track Firefox history

**Trade-off**: Slightly slower tracking, but works reliably.

### Space Filtering

When using [Spaces](spaces), recent items can be filtered by current space:

1. Open **Preferences → Recents**
2. Enable **Show only items from current space**
3. Only recent items from websites saved to current space appear

Perfect for focused work contexts.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Recent items don't have dedicated shortcuts, but integrate with:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃K** | Open command panel (search recent items) |
| **↑** / **↓** | Navigate through recent items in sidebar |
| **Return** | Open selected recent item |

## Tips & Tricks

### Research Workflow
1. Browse and research without saving
2. Review recent items at end of session
3. Save keepers, let temporary items expire

No need to save every page "just in case" - your recent items serve as temporary storage.

### Cross-Browser History
Work across Safari, Chrome, and Firefox? Recent Items shows all browser history in one unified list - no more checking each browser's history separately.

### Accidental Closure Recovery
Closed a tab by accident? Check recent items to quickly reopen it.

### Pattern Discovery
Review your recent items to discover:
- Sites you visit frequently (consider saving or pinning)
- Research rabbit holes
- Time spent on different topics

### Combine with Smart Folders
Create a [Smart Folder](smartFolders) to collect recent items:
- Condition: Created in last 7 days
- Shows everything you've saved this week, not just visited

### Clean Workflow
Don't clutter your saved links with one-time research. Let recent items handle temporary pages, save only what matters.

## Privacy & Storage

### Local Only
Recent items are stored locally on your Mac using Core Data. No browsing history is sent to external servers.

### iCloud Sync (Optional)
If iCloud sync is enabled, recent items sync across your devices. Disable in **Preferences → Sync** if you prefer local-only.

### Manual Cleanup
Want to clear recent items manually?

1. Right-click any recent item
2. Select **Delete**
3. Removed from recents (doesn't affect browser history)

Or wait 30 days for automatic cleanup.

## Troubleshooting

**Recent items not appearing?**
- Verify automation permissions are granted for your browsers
- Ensure **Recent Items** mode is selected (not Live Tabs)
- Check browser is in the supported list
- For Firefox: Enable Firefox keyboard shortcuts in preferences

**Duplicate items showing?**
- This shouldn't happen - report bug to support
- Recent Items should update timestamp, not create duplicates

**Items disappearing too quickly?**
- Items auto-delete after 30 days
- Save important items to make them permanent

**Wrong browser icon showing?**
- Clear recents and track again
- Report issue if persists
