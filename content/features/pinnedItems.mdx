# Pinned Items

Lightning-fast access to your most important links with single-keystroke shortcuts - perfect for websites, apps, and files you use every day.

## When to Use

- Instant access to daily-use tools (email, calendar, project management)
- One-key shortcuts for frequently opened applications
- Quick launch for commonly referenced documentation
- Speed up repetitive workflows with keyboard-only access
- Prioritize your most critical resources above everything else

## How It Works

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing pinned items section at top of sidebar with numbered badges]

Pinned items appear at the very top of your sidebar, marked with a pin icon. Assign keyboard shortcuts (⌘⌥1 through ⌘⌥9) to open your first 9 pinned items instantly from anywhere on your Mac.

### One-Keystroke Access

Press **⌘⌥1** → Opens your first pinned item
Press **⌘⌥2** → Opens your second pinned item
...and so on up to **⌘⌥9**

No searching, no clicking, no context switching - just instant access.

## Setup

### Pinning Items

**From Sidebar:**
1. Right-click any link, file, or folder
2. Select **Pin to Top**
3. Item moves to the Pinned section

**With Keyboard:**
1. Select an item with arrow keys
2. Press **⌘P**
3. Item is pinned

### Reordering Pins

Drag pinned items up or down to change their keyboard shortcut assignments:
- First pin → **⌘⌥1**
- Second pin → **⌘⌥2**
- Third pin → **⌘⌥3**
- ...and so on

### Enabling Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts for pinned items are optional:

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Enable **Pinned item number shortcuts**
3. Press **⌘⌥1-9** to open pins 1-9

Disable if you need these shortcuts for other applications.

## Using Pinned Items

### Opening Pins

**From Sidebar:**
- Click any pinned item
- Navigate with arrow keys and press Return

**With Keyboard (anywhere on Mac):**
- **⌘⌥1** through **⌘⌥9** to open pins 1-9

### Unpinning Items

**From Sidebar:**
1. Right-click the pinned item
2. Select **Unpin**

**With Keyboard:**
1. Select the pinned item
2. Press **⌘P** to toggle pin off

Item returns to its original location in your folders.

### Pins Across Spaces

Pinned items are **global** - they appear in all [Spaces](spaces). This makes sense for items you need regardless of context (email, calendar, notes).

For space-specific quick access, use folder organization instead.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Tips & Tricks

### Muscle Memory Optimization
Arrange your most-used items in positions 1-3 for fastest access. Reserve positions 4-9 for less frequent but still important items.

### Visual Feedback
When you trigger a pinned item shortcut, SupaSidebar shows a notification with the item name - helpful when building muscle memory.

### Browser-Specific Pins
Pin the same website multiple times with different browser assignments:
- Pin 1: Gmail in Chrome
- Pin 2: Gmail in Safari
Each opens the same site in different browsers.

### Local File Quick Access
Pin frequently accessed folders:
- Documents folder
- Downloads folder
- Project directory
Press the shortcut to open in Finder instantly.

### App Launchers
Pin applications for keyboard-driven app launching:
- Add app to sidebar (drag from Applications folder)
- Pin it
- Launch with ⌘⌥[number]

### Pin Limit
While the sidebar can display unlimited pinned items, only the first 9 get keyboard shortcuts. Keep your pin count reasonable for best usability.

### Workflow Chains
Combine pinned items with [Spaces](spaces):
- Switch to "Work" space: **⌘⌃1**
- Open work email: **⌘⌥1**
- Open project board: **⌘⌥2**

Two keystrokes and you're ready to work.

## Troubleshooting

**Shortcut not working?**
- Verify shortcuts are enabled in Preferences → General
- Check for conflicts with other apps using ⌘⌥1-9
- Ensure item is within first 9 pins (only first 9 get shortcuts)

**"Pin [number] Not Available" error?**
- You don't have that many items pinned
- Example: Only 3 pins, but you pressed ⌘⌥5
- Pin more items or use a lower number

**Item opening in wrong browser?**
- Right-click the pinned item
- Select **Set Browser**
- Choose your preferred browser
