# Attach to Browser

Sidebar floats alongside your browser window without resizing it.

## How It Works

{/* TODO: Add image showing Attach mode behavior */}
{/* ![Attach Mode](/assets/browser-integration/attach.jpeg) */}

When enabled, the sidebar appears next to your browser. The browser window stays at its current size - the sidebar simply floats beside it.

## Setup

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Set **Browser Integration** to **Attach**
3. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

## When to Use

- You want the sidebar visible while browsing
- You prefer manual control over window sizes
- You have a large monitor with extra space

## Profile Mode

When the current space is linked to a browser profile, Attach mode locks onto that profile's window specifically. The sidebar:

- **Attaches** to the profile's browser window only (ignores other browser windows)
- **Auto-hides** when you click away from the profile browser
- **Re-shows** with the profile browser window when you toggle the sidebar back

This ensures the sidebar always stays paired with the correct browser context.
