# Attach to Browser

Sidebar floats alongside your browser window without resizing it.

## How It Works

{/* TODO: Add image showing Attach mode behavior */}
{/* ![Attach Mode](/assets/browser-integration/attach.jpeg) */}

When enabled, the sidebar appears next to your browser. The browser window stays at its current size - the sidebar simply floats beside it.

## Setup

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Set **Browser Integration** to **Attach**
3. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

## When to Use

- You want the sidebar visible while browsing
- You prefer manual control over window sizes
- You have a large monitor with extra space
