# Smart Positioning

Automatically moves browser windows that overlap with the sidebar.

## How It Works

{/* TODO: Add image showing Smart mode behavior */}
{/* ![Smart Mode](/assets/browser-integration/smart.jpeg) */}

When the sidebar opens, any browser window overlapping its position slides over. When the sidebar closes, windows return to their original position.

## Setup

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Set **Browser Integration** to **Smart**
3. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

## When to Use

- You want automatic window management
- You frequently toggle the sidebar on/off
- You don't want to manually arrange windows
