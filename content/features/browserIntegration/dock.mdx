# Dock Mode

Browser maximizes to full screen when the sidebar closes.

## How It Works

The sidebar acts like a dock - when visible, it takes its space. When hidden, your browser automatically maximizes to use the full screen.

## Setup

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Set **Browser Integration** to **Dock**
3. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

## When to Use

- You want full-screen browsing when sidebar is hidden
- You frequently switch between sidebar and full browser
- You prefer automatic maximize behavior
