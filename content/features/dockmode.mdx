# Dock Mode :

**A native-feeling sidebar that makes space instead of getting in the way.**  
Dock Mode pushes your browser windows aside instead of overlapping them, giving SupaSidebar the behavior of a built-in browser sidebar while keeping your workspace clean and focused.

## How It Works :

When Dock Mode is enabled, SupaSidebar docks itself to the edge of your screen.

As the sidebar appears, your browser window automatically resizes to make room.  
When the sidebar hides, the window returns to full width — seamlessly and instantly.

No overlapping. No manual resizing. No broken layouts.

## Native Sidebar Behavior :

Dock Mode mirrors how sidebars behave in modern browsers and desktop apps:

- Browser windows are **pushed aside**, not covered
- Window width is **automatically restored** when the sidebar closes
- Layout remains stable with no flicker or jumps
- Works consistently across supported browsers

The result feels natural — like the sidebar was always part of your browser.

## When to Use Dock Mode :

- **Focused work**  
  Keep references, notes, or saved links visible without hiding your main content.

- **Side-by-side workflows**  
  Browse and organize links simultaneously.

- **Wide screens**  
  Make better use of large and ultrawide displays.

- **Long work sessions**  
  Avoid constant window resizing and visual clutter.

## Dock Mode vs Overlay Mode :

### Dock Mode
- Sidebar reserves its own space
- No content overlap
- Best for deep focus and extended sessions

### Overlay Mode
- Sidebar floats above content
- Faster, temporary access
- Ideal for quick actions

You can switch between modes anytime based on your workflow.
