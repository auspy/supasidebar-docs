# Browser Support

SupaSidebar works seamlessly with 14 major web browsers through AppleScript integration - save pages, copy URLs, and track tabs across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Arc, and more.

## When to Use

- **Multi-browser workflows**: Work across Safari for personal, Chrome for work, Firefox for development
- **Browser flexibility**: Choose the right browser for each task without losing integration
- **No extensions needed**: AppleScript-based integration works without installing browser extensions
- **Cross-browser tracking**: Monitor tabs and activity across all your browsers simultaneously
- **Browser-specific features**: Take advantage of Live Tabs, URL extraction, and window management
- **Permission-based control**: Grant access only to browsers you actually use

## How It Works

[PLACEHOLDER: Diagram showing SupaSidebar connecting to multiple browsers via AppleScript]

SupaSidebar uses AppleScript to communicate with browsers, enabling:
- Extract current page title and URL
- Detect which browser is active
- Monitor open tabs in real-time (Live Tabs)
- Open saved links in specific browsers
- Control browser windows (resize, position)

All without browser extensions or manual configuration.

## Setup

### Required Permissions

Browser integration requires **Automation permissions**:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**
2. Find **SupaSidebar** in the list
3. Enable checkboxes for all browsers you use

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing System Settings automation permissions with multiple browsers enabled]

**First Time Setup:**
When you first use browser shortcuts, macOS will prompt for permission for each browser. Click **OK** to grant access.

**Grant for All Browsers:**
Even if you primarily use one browser, enabling all provides flexibility to switch browsers without setup later.

### Optional: Accessibility Permissions

Some browsers benefit from Accessibility access for enhanced features:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** → Enable SupaSidebar

**Browsers that benefit:**
- **Comet (Perplexity)**: Enhanced URL extraction from internal URLs
- **Other browsers**: May improve reliability in edge cases

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing Accessibility permissions]

### Verifying Permissions

To test if permissions are working:

1. Open a browser (e.g., Safari)
2. Navigate to any webpage
3. Press **⌘⌃S** (Smart Save)
4. Page should be added to sidebar with notification

If nothing happens, check Automation permissions.

## Multi-Browser Workflows

### Dedicate Browsers to Contexts

Use different browsers for different tasks:

- **Chrome** → Work sites (Gmail, Slack, company tools)
- **Safari** → Personal browsing (news, shopping, social)
- **Firefox** → Development (localhost, debugging, dev tools)

SupaSidebar tracks activity across all of them:
- Save from any browser with same shortcut
- [Command Panel](commandPanel) searches across all saved links
- [Live Tabs](liveTabs) shows tabs from all browsers simultaneously
- [Recent Items](recentItems) captures visits across browsers

### Browser Assignment Per Link

Choose which browser opens each saved link:

1. Save page from any browser
2. Right-click saved link in sidebar
3. Select **Set Browser**
4. Choose preferred browser

Next time you open that link, it uses the assigned browser.

See [Browser Selection](browserSelection) for advanced workflows.

### Browser-Based Organization

Create [Smart Folders](smartFolders) to organize by browser:

**Smart Folder: Chrome Work Links**
- Condition: Browser is "Chrome"
- All Chrome-saved links collected automatically

**Smart Folder: Safari Personal**
- Condition: Browser is "Safari"
- Personal browsing kept separate
