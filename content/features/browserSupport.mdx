# Browser Support

SupaSidebar works seamlessly with 14 major web browsers through AppleScript integration - save pages, copy URLs, and track tabs across Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Arc, and more.


## How It Works


SupaSidebar uses AppleScript to communicate with browsers, enabling:
- Extract current page title and URL
- Detect which browser is active
- Monitor open tabs in real-time (Live Tabs)
- Open saved links in specific browsers
- Control browser windows (resize, position)

All without browser extensions or manual configuration.

## Supported Browsers

### Integration Levels

SupaSidebar provides two levels of browser integration:

**Basic Integration** [smart copy(⌘⌃C) and Smart Save (⌘⌃S)] - Available for all 14 browsers:

**Live Tabs** - Available for 10 browsers(Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Comet, Orion, Atlas(ChatGPT), Helium):


## Setup

### Required Permissions

Browser integration requires **Automation permissions** and for Accessibility access for enhanced features:

***refer to***  :  [Set Up](SetUp)


Use different browsers for different tasks:

**Example Setup:**
- **Chrome** → Work sites (Gmail, Slack, company tools)
- **Safari** → Personal browsing (news, shopping, social)
- **Firefox** → Development (localhost, debugging, dev tools)

SupaSidebar tracks activity across all of them:
- Save from any browser with same shortcut
- [Command Panel](commandPanel) searches across all saved links
- [Live Tabs](liveTabs) shows tabs from all browsers simultaneously
- [Recent Items](recentItems) captures visits across browsers

### Browser Assignment Per Link

Choose which browser opens each saved link:

1. Save page from any browser
2. Right-click saved link in sidebar
3. Select **Set Browser**
4. Choose preferred browser

Next time you open that link, it uses the assigned browser.

See [Browser Selection](browserSelection) for advanced workflows.

### Browser-Based Organization

Create [Smart Folders](smartFolders) to organize by browser:

**Smart Folder: Chrome Work Links**
- Condition: Browser is "Chrome"
- All Chrome-saved links collected automatically

**Smart Folder: Safari Personal**
- Condition: Browser is "Safari"
- Personal browsing kept separate

## Live Tabs Integration

For browsers with Live Tabs support (✅), SupaSidebar provides real-time tab tracking:


**Supported Browsers for Live Tabs:**
Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Comet, Orion, Atlas, Helium (9 browsers)

**Coming Soon (⏳):**
Firefox, Arc, Dia

See [Live Tabs](liveTabs) for detailed documentation.


## Troubleshooting

### Smart Save Not Working

**Issue:** Pressing ⌘⌃S does nothing in browser

**Solutions:**
1. Check Automation permissions: System Settings → Automation → SupaSidebar → Enable your browser
2. Ensure browser window is active (frontmost)
3. Try closing and reopening the browser
4. Restart SupaSidebar
5. Verify browser is in supported list above

### Permission Denied Error (-1743)

**Issue:** Error message when using browser shortcuts

**Solutions:**
1. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
2. Find SupaSidebar
3. Enable checkbox for the specific browser
4. Restart both SupaSidebar and the browser
5. Try the shortcut again

### Live Tabs Not Showing

**Issue:** Tabs not appearing in sidebar for supported browser

**Solutions:**
1. Verify browser has ✅ for Live Tabs in compatibility matrix above
2. Check Automation permissions are granted
3. Enable Live Tabs in Preferences → Recents
4. Ensure browser has at least one open tab
5. Try refreshing (cmd + R in Recent Items)

See [Live Tabs Troubleshooting](liveTabs#troubleshooting) for more details.

### Wrong URL Extracted

**Issue:** Saved URL is incorrect or internal

**Solutions:**
1. For Comet browser: Enable Accessibility permissions
2. Ensure you're on the actual webpage (not browser settings)
3. Wait for page to fully load before pressing ⌘⌃S
4. Try refreshing the page and saving again

### Browser Not Detected

**Issue:** SupaSidebar doesn't detect browser is active

**Solutions:**
1. Click the browser window to make it frontmost
2. Ensure browser is listed in supported browsers above
3. Check browser name matches (e.g., "Google Chrome" not just "Chrome")
4. Grant Automation permissions
5. Restart both apps

### Shortcuts Work Inconsistently

**Issue:** Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't

**Solutions:**
1. Check for shortcut conflicts with other apps
2. Ensure browser window is truly active (not just visible)
3. Verify permissions haven't been revoked
4. Try disabling other automation tools temporarily
5. Check Console.app for errors
