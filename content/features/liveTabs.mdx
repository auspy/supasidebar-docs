# Live Tabs

Real-time mirror of your currently open browser tabs directly in the sidebar - switch between tabs across all browsers without leaving your keyboard.

## When to Use

- **Research management**: Handle dozens of tabs across multiple browsers in one view
- **Quick tab switching**: Switch to specific tabs without Alt-Tabbing through applications
- **Tab cleanup**: Close tabs you no longer need without opening each browser
- **Avoid duplicates**: Reuse existing tabs instead of opening duplicates when clicking links
- **Work overview**: See all your active work at a glance across all browsers

## How It Works

Live Tabs continuously monitors your supported browsers and displays all open tabs in real-time within the sidebar. Each tab shows its title, URL, and browser icon.

### Real-Time Synchronization

SupaSidebar uses two methods to keep tabs in sync:

**Polling Mode** (All versions)
Checks browsers every 0.75 seconds for tab updates via AppleScript.

**Accessibility Observer** (Direct Distribution only)
Instant updates using macOS Accessibility API when tabs are created, switched, or closed - no polling delay.

Live Tabs works across all supported browsers simultaneously:

- Safari
- Chrome
- Edge
- Brave
- Vivaldi
- Comet
- Orion

### Browser Order Customization

Organize which browsers appear first in your live tabs list:

1. Open **Preferences → Live Tabs**
2. Drag browsers to reorder priority
3. Your most-used browser's tabs will appear first

## Setup

### Enable Live Tabs

1. Open **Preferences → Recents**
2. Toggle **Live Tabs** mode
3. Grant browser permissions when prompted

### Required Permissions

Live Tabs requires **Automation permissions** for each browser:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**
2. Find **SupaSidebar**
3. Enable checkboxes for all browsers you use

For enhanced real-time updates (Direct Distribution):
- **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility** → Enable SupaSidebar

**From Sidebar:**
1. Navigate to the tab with arrow keys or click

**From Command Panel:**

### Close Tabs

Right-click any live tab in the sidebar and select **Close Tab** to close it without opening the browser.

### Smart Tab Reuse

When Live Tabs is enabled and you open a link from SupaSidebar:

- If the URL is already open in a tab, SupaSidebar **activates that tab** instead of creating a duplicate
- Works across all browsers - even if the tab is in Chrome and you clicked a link configured for Safari

This keeps your tab count manageable and prevents duplicate research tabs.

## Space-Filtered Tabs (Premium)

When using [Spaces](spaces), Live Tabs can show only tabs from websites saved to your current space:

1. Open **Preferences → Live Tabs**
2. Enable **Filter by current space**
3. Only relevant tabs appear in the sidebar

Example: Working in your "Work" space? Only see tabs from work-related domains.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃K** | Open command panel (shows all tabs) |
| **↑** / **↓** | Navigate through tabs |
| **Return** | Switch to selected tab |

## Tips & Tricks

### Research Workflow
1. Open multiple tabs for research across browsers
2. Use **⌘⌃K** to search tabs by keyword
3. Switch between relevant tabs without touching your mouse
4. Right-click tabs to close distractions

### Cross-Browser Tab Management
Working across Safari and Chrome? Live Tabs shows everything in one unified list - no more forgetting which browser has which tab.

### Performance Optimization
Live Tabs intelligently reduces polling frequency for background browsers to save CPU cycles. Active browser tabs update fastest.

### Prevent Duplicate Tabs
Before opening a link, SupaSidebar checks if you already have it open. This "tab reuse" feature is automatic when Live Tabs is enabled - no configuration needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Tabs not appearing?**
- Verify automation permissions are granted in System Settings
- Ensure Live Tabs mode is enabled in Preferences → Recents
- Check that your browser is in the supported list

**Tabs updating slowly?**
- Grant Accessibility permissions for real-time updates (Direct Distribution only)
- Close unused browsers to improve performance

**Tabs from wrong space showing?**
- Enable "Filter by current space" in Preferences → Live Tabs
- Ensure websites are saved to the correct space
