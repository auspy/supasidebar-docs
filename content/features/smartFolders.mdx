# Smart Folders

Dynamic folders that automatically organize your links based on rules - like smart playlists for your bookmarks.

## Features

- **Rule-Based** - Define conditions and links auto-organize
- **Match Modes** - ANY (OR) or ALL (AND) logic for conditions
- **Live Updates** - Folders update as you save, edit, or delete links
- **References** - Smart folder links are references, not copies

## Conditions

Smart folders support these condition types:

**General**
- **Link Type** - Web links, apps, or files
- **Source Space** - Links from specific workspace(s)
- **Source Folder** - Links from specific folder (or unfiled)
- **Folder Name** - Match parent folder name pattern
- **Date Range** - `today`, `yesterday`, `last7days`, `last30days`, `thisWeek`, `thisMonth`, `thisYear`
- **Tags** - Match links by their tags (single tag, ANY of multiple, or ALL of multiple)

**URL**
- **URL Pattern** - Wildcards supported (e.g., `*.figma.com`)
- **Domain** - Exact domain match

**Files**
- **File Extension** - Match extension (e.g., `pdf`, `.docx`)
- **File Path** - Match path pattern (supports `contains:`, `starts:`, `ends:`, wildcards)

### Tag Matching

The Tags condition supports flexible matching:

| Pattern | Matches |

| `work` | Links with the "work" tag |
| `any:work,urgent` | Links with "work" OR "urgent" tag |

Use the tag picker in the editor to select tags visually, or enter patterns manually.
