# Smart Folders

Dynamic folders that automatically organize your links based on rules - like smart playlists for your bookmarks.

## When to Use

- Automatically collect all links from a specific domain (e.g., all GitHub repositories)
- Group links by type (websites, files, folders)
- Create date-based folders (links added this week, this month)
- Organize client work by matching URL patterns
- Build reading lists that auto-update as you save articles

## How It Works

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing a smart folder with auto-matched links]

Smart Folders use rules to automatically include links that match specific conditions. Instead of manually dragging links into folders, define the criteria once and let SupaSidebar do the organizing.

### Rule-Based Organization

Each smart folder contains:
- **Conditions**: Rules that links must match
- **Match Mode**: ANY (OR logic) or ALL (AND logic)
- **Source Filtering**: Limit to specific spaces or folders

When you save a link that matches the rules, it automatically appears in the smart folder - no manual sorting required.

## Setup

### Creating a Smart Folder

1. Right-click in the sidebar or folder area
2. Select **New Smart Folder**
3. Name your folder (e.g., "GitHub Projects", "Work Research")
4. Click **Add Condition** to define rules

### Adding Conditions

Click **Add Condition** and choose a condition type:

**URL Pattern**
- Matches: Contains, Starts with, Ends with, Equals
- Example: URL contains "github.com" → Collects all GitHub links

**Domain**
- Matches links from a specific domain
- Example: Domain equals "reddit.com" → All Reddit links

**Link Type**
- Filter by: Web links, File system items, or All types
- Example: Link type is "File" → Only files and folders

**Source Space**
- Matches links from specific workspace(s)
- Example: Source space is "Work" → Links saved in Work space

**Source Folder**
- Matches links from specific folder(s)
- Example: Source folder is "Client A" → All Client A links

**Date Range**
- Filter by creation date
- Example: Created in last 7 days → Recent additions

### Match Modes

**ANY (OR logic)**: Link matches *at least one* condition
- Example: URL contains "github.com" OR URL contains "gitlab.com"
- Use for: Collecting similar items from different sources

**ALL (AND logic)**: Link matches *all* conditions
- Example: URL contains "docs" AND Source space is "Work"
- Use for: Precise filtering with multiple criteria

## Using Smart Folders

### Auto-Organization

Smart folders update automatically:
- Save a link → It appears in matching smart folders instantly
- Edit a link's URL → Smart folder membership updates
- Delete a link → Removed from all smart folders

### Manual Overrides

Links in smart folders are **references** - deleting from a smart folder doesn't delete the original link. To permanently delete, remove from the source folder.

### Nested Smart Folders

Smart folders can be nested inside regular folders for hierarchical organization:

```
📁 Work
  ├── 🔍 Recent Work Links (smart folder)
  ├── 🔍 Client Websites (smart folder)
  └── 📁 Archives (regular folder)
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Domain-Based Organization
Create smart folders for frequently visited domains:
- "Twitter" → domain equals "twitter.com"
- "YouTube" → domain equals "youtube.com"
- "Stack Overflow" → domain equals "stackoverflow.com"

### Temporary Smart Folders
Create a "Last 7 Days" smart folder to review recent saves before deciding where to file them permanently.

### Project-Based Collection
Use URL patterns to collect project-related links:
- "Project Apollo" → URL contains "apollo-project"
- All links with that keyword auto-organize

### Combine with Spaces
Create work-specific smart folders:
- Condition 1: Source space is "Work"
- Condition 2: URL contains "company-domain.com"
- Result: Only work links from company domain

### Reading List Workflow
1. Create smart folder: Link type = Web, Created in last 30 days
2. All saved articles appear automatically
3. Review and move keepers to permanent folders
4. Old articles age out after 30 days
