# Floating Button

A persistent, draggable button that floats above all windows for one-click sidebar access - perfect for mouse-driven workflows.

## When to Use

- Prefer visual, mouse-driven access over keyboard shortcuts
- Want a always-visible reminder that SupaSidebar is available
- Use tablet or stylus input frequently
- Work on large displays where keyboard is far from mouse
- Combine with keyboard shortcuts for hybrid access

## How It Works

[PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot showing small floating button in corner of screen]

The Floating Button is a small, semi-transparent button that stays visible above all other windows. Click it once to toggle the sidebar - no keyboard needed.

### Persistent & Draggable

**Always Visible:**
- Floats above all applications
- Visible across all desktop spaces
- Never gets hidden behind windows
- Small enough not to obstruct work

**Fully Draggable:**
- Drag to any position on screen
- Position persists across app restarts
- Move to corners, edges, or anywhere you prefer
- Works across multiple displays

## Setup

### Enable Floating Button

1. Open **Preferences → General**
2. Enable **Show floating button**
3. Button appears immediately

### No Permissions Required

The floating button works without any special permissions - just toggle it on and it appears.

## Using the Floating Button

### Toggle Sidebar

**Single Click:**
- Sidebar hidden → Click button → Sidebar appears
- Sidebar visible → Click button → Sidebar hides

Simple, predictable toggle behavior.

### Repositioning

**Drag to Move:**
1. Click and hold the button
2. Drag to desired position
3. Release to place

**Position Persistence:**
Your chosen position is saved:
- Survives app restarts
- Persists across macOS reboots
- Separate position for each display


### Multi-Display Support

On multi-monitor setups:
- Button position scales to screen dimensions
- Automatically adjusts when switching displays
- Each display can have the button at different relative positions

## Customization

### Button Appearance

The floating button is designed to be subtle:
- Small circular or icon button
- Semi-transparent to reduce visual noise
- Unobtrusive color scheme
- Respects macOS light/dark mode

No customization options - optimized for minimal distraction.

### Position Presets

**Recommended Positions:**

**Top-Right Corner:**
- Out of the way of most content
- Easy to reach with mouse
- Common position for utility buttons

**Top-Left Corner:**
- Near macOS menu bar
- Good for left-handed users
- Alternative to right corner

**Bottom-Right Corner:**
- Near macOS Dock area
- Familiar position for system utilities
- Easy thumb reach on trackpad

**Bottom-Left Corner:**
- Away from Dock
- Alternative for left-handed workflows

## Combining Access Methods

### Hybrid Workflows

Use the floating button alongside other access methods:

**Mouse + Keyboard:**
- Click button when hand is on mouse
- Press **⌘⇧Space** when typing
- Best of both worlds

**Mouse Triggers + Button:**
- Edge triggers for quick access while browsing
- Floating button for precision when needed
- Multiple options for different contexts

**Button + Command Panel:**
- Click button to show sidebar
- Press **⌘⌃K** for focused search
- Different tasks, different tools

## Tips & Tricks

### Unobtrusive Positioning

Place button in screen corners you rarely use:
- Top corners for centered work (writing, design)
- Bottom corners for top-heavy work (reading, browsing)
- Opposite side from Dock and notifications

### Large Display Strategy

On ultra-wide or large displays:
- Position button near center of screen edge
- Reduces mouse travel distance
- Faster access than corner positions

### Temporary Disable

Don't want the button during specific tasks?
1. Open Preferences
2. Toggle off "Show floating button"
3. Re-enable later as needed

Faster than repositioning.

### Multi-Monitor Workflows

On multi-monitor setups:
- Position button near screen edges that face each other
- Example: Left monitor → button on right edge
- Easier to hit when moving between displays

### Tablet/Stylus Users

For tablet or stylus input:
- Floating button is more accessible than keyboard shortcuts
- Larger click target than menu bar icons
- Drag to convenient stylus-reachable position

### Touchscreen Macs

On touchscreen-capable Macs (if applicable):
- Floating button works with touch input
- Large enough touch target
- Position in comfortable reach zones

## Alternative Access Methods

If the floating button isn't for you, try:

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **⌘⇧Space** - Toggle sidebar
- See [Global Shortcuts](globalShortcuts) for complete list

**Mouse Triggers:**
- Move mouse to screen edge to show sidebar
- See [Mouse Triggers](mouseTriggers) for setup

**Menu Bar Icon:**
- Click SupaSidebar icon in menu bar
- Select "Show Sidebar"

**Browser Auto-Visibility:**
- Sidebar appears automatically when browsers activate
- See [Browser Integration](browserIntegration#browser-auto-visibility)

## Troubleshooting

**Button not appearing?**
- Verify "Show floating button" is enabled in Preferences
- Try toggling off and on again
- Restart SupaSidebar

**Button in wrong position?**
- Drag button to desired location
- Position is saved automatically
- Check button isn't hidden off-screen edge

**Button too small/hard to click?**
- Unfortunately, button size is not customizable
- Use keyboard shortcuts or mouse triggers instead
- Submit feedback for larger button option

**Button blocking content?**
- Drag to different position
- Use semi-transparent appearance (automatic)
- Consider disabling and using keyboard shortcuts

**Button disappeared after display change?**
- Button may be positioned off-screen
- Disable and re-enable floating button
- It will reappear at default position

**Multiple displays showing duplicate buttons?**
- This shouldn't happen - only one button appears
- Report bug to support if you see duplicates

## Performance

### Minimal Impact

The floating button is lightweight:
- Minimal CPU usage (event-driven, not polling)

- Efficient rendering

### Always-On-Top
