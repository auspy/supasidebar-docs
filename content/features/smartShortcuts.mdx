# Smart Shortcuts

Context-aware keyboard shortcuts that adapt based on your active application - save browser pages or Finder items, copy URLs or file paths, all with the same shortcuts.


## How It Works

 Smart Copy and Save
  </a>
</div>

Smart Shortcuts detect which application is currently active and adapt their behavior automatically. No need to remember different shortcuts for different apps - **⌘⌃S** and **⌘⌃C** do the right thing based on context.

### Context-Aware Behavior

The magic of Smart Shortcuts is their intelligent context detection:

**In a Browser** (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.):
- **⌘⌃S** → Saves current page title and URL
- **⌘⌃C** → Copies current page URL to clipboard

**In Finder**:
- **⌘⌃S** → Adds selected files/folders to sidebar
- **⌘⌃C** → Copies file paths to clipboard

**Anywhere Else**:
- Defaults to browser behavior (attempts to find frontmost browser)

## Smart Save (⌘⌃S)

### In Browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Smart Save Not Working in Browser

**Issue:** Pressing ⌘⌃S does nothing in browser

**Solutions:**
- Verify browser is supported (see [Browser Support](browserSupport))
- Check Automation permissions: System Settings → Automation → SupaSidebar → Enable your browser
- Make sure browser window is active (frontmost)
- Try closing and reopening the browser
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Smart Save Not Working in Finder

**Issue:** Files not being added when pressing ⌘⌃S in Finder

**Solutions:**
- Ensure files or folders are selected in Finder
- Check Automation permissions: System Settings → Automation → SupaSidebar → Enable Finder
- Make sure Finder window is active (frontmost)
- Try selecting files again and pressing ⌘⌃S
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Smart Copy Copies Wrong Content

**Issue:** ⌘⌃C copies file path instead of URL (or vice versa)

**Solutions:**
- Check which app is currently active (frontmost)
- Click the window you want to copy from first
- Then press ⌘⌃C
- Smart Shortcuts detect the active app, not just visible apps

### Permission Denied Error (-1743)

**Issue:** Error message when using shortcuts

**Solutions:**
- Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
- Find SupaSidebar
- Enable checkboxes for all apps you use (browsers and Finder)
- Restart both SupaSidebar and the relevant apps
- Try the shortcut again

### Nothing Happens When Pressing Shortcuts

**Issue:** No feedback or action when using ⌘⌃S or ⌘⌃C

**Solutions:**
- Verify shortcuts aren't conflicting with other apps
- Check if another app is capturing these shortcuts
- Try customizing the shortcuts in Preferences → Shortcuts
- Ensure SupaSidebar is running (check menu bar icon)
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Wrong Browser Detected

**Issue:** Smart Save detects wrong browser or fails to detect browser

**Solutions:**
- Make sure the browser window is frontmost (active)
- Click the browser window before pressing ⌘⌃S
- Some browsers need explicit Automation permissions
- Check browser is in supported list: [Browser Support](browserSupport)
