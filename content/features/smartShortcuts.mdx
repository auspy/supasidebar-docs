# Smart Shortcuts

Context-aware keyboard shortcuts that adapt based on your active application - save browser pages or Finder items, copy URLs or file paths, all with the same shortcuts.

## When to Use

- **Unified workflow**: Use the same shortcuts across different applications without thinking
- **Browser capture**: Save interesting web pages instantly while researching
- **File management**: Add files and folders to sidebar without drag-and-drop
- **Quick URL copying**: Share links from any browser with a single keystroke
- **Path extraction**: Copy file paths for documentation, terminal, or scripts
- **Context switching**: Work seamlessly between browser and Finder tasks

## How It Works

 Smart Copy and Save
  </a>
</p>

Smart Shortcuts detect which application is currently active and adapt their behavior automatically. No need to remember different shortcuts for different apps - **⌘⌃S** and **⌘⌃C** do the right thing based on context.

### Context-Aware Behavior

The magic of Smart Shortcuts is their intelligent context detection:

**In a Browser** (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.):
- **⌘⌃S** → Saves current page title and URL
- **⌘⌃C** → Copies current page URL to clipboard

**In Finder**:
- **⌘⌃S** → Adds selected files/folders to sidebar
- **⌘⌃C** → Copies file paths to clipboard

**Anywhere Else**:
- Defaults to browser behavior (attempts to find frontmost browser)

## Smart Save (⌘⌃S)

### In Browsers

Press **⌘⌃S** while browsing to instantly capture the current page:

**What Gets Saved:**
- Page title (automatically extracted)
- Full URL
- Timestamp
- Browser that was active


**Supported Browsers:**
Works with all 14 supported browsers including Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Arc, Brave, Vivaldi, Comet, Orion, Atlas, Zen, Wavebox, Dia, and Helium.

See [Browser Support](browserSupport) for complete compatibility details.

**Workflow Example:**
1. Researching a topic in Chrome
2. Find useful article
3. Press **⌘⌃S** - saved instantly
4. Continue browsing
5. Find another page
6. Press **⌘⌃S** again - saved
7. All pages waiting in sidebar when you're done

No interruption to your flow.

### In Finder

Press **⌘⌃S** in Finder to add selected files and folders:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/saved links.jpeg" alt="Saved Links" width="800" />
</p>

**Multiple Selection:**
Select as many files/folders as you want → Press **⌘⌃S** → All added at once

**Notification Feedback:**

### Custom Link Names

**Browser Pages:**
SupaSidebar automatically fetches the page title, but you can rename:
1. Find the saved link in sidebar
2. Press **Space** or **⌘R**
3. Type new name

**Finder Items:**
File and folder names are preserved from Finder. Rename the same way if needed.

## Smart Copy (⌘⌃C)

### In Browsers

## Tips & Tricks

### Muscle Memory Benefits

Use the same shortcuts everywhere:
- No mental overhead switching between apps
- Faster workflows without thinking
- One shortcut combo = multiple uses
- Perfect for keyboard-first productivity

### Browser + Finder Projects

Create comprehensive project collections:
1. Save related web documentation (**⌘⌃S** in browser)
2. Add project files (**⌘⌃S** in Finder)
3. Add reference PDFs (**⌘⌃S** in Finder)
4. Save design inspiration (**⌘⌃S** in browser)
5. Everything organized in sidebar

### URL Sharing Speed

**⌘⌃C** is faster than:
- Right-click → Copy link
- Selecting URL in address bar
- Using browser's share menu

Instant URL copying from any page.

### File Path Efficiency

Copy paths for:
- **Terminal**: `open /path/to/file`
- **Documentation**: Reference exact file locations
- **Scripts**: Process specific files
- **Collaboration**: Share file locations with team

### Context Detection Reliability

If you're unsure which app is active:
- Smart Shortcuts detect the **frontmost application**
- Works even with multiple browser windows
- Finder must be active (not just visible) for Finder mode
- When in doubt, click the window first, then use shortcut

### Combine with Command Panel

Save now, find later:
1. Press **⌘⌃S** throughout your day (browser and Finder)
2. Later, press **⌘⌃K** to open command panel
3. Search across everything you saved
4. Works for both web pages and files

See [Command Panel](commandPanel) for search tips.

### Add Current Folder vs. Selection

**⌘⌃S** in Finder adds what you've selected, but sometimes you want the folder itself:

Use **⌘⌥A** to add the current folder, ignoring any file selection.

**Example:**
- Browsing ~/Projects/ClientA
- Files are selected
- Press **⌘⌥A** → Adds ClientA folder, not selected files

See [Finder Integration](finderIntegration) for details.

## Advanced Features

### Browser Selection for Saved Pages

After saving with **⌘⌃S**, you can choose which browser opens that link:

1. Find saved link in sidebar
2. Right-click → **Set Browser**
3. Choose preferred browser

Or use **⌥Click** or **⌥Return** for one-time browser selection.

See [Browser Selection](browserSelection) for multi-browser workflows.

### Multi-Browser Research

Smart Save works across all browsers simultaneously:
- Save from Chrome
- Switch to Firefox
- Save from Firefox
- Switch to Safari
- Save from Safari
- All pages captured in sidebar

See [Browser Support](browserSupport) for supported browsers.

### File Type Organization

Use [Smart Folders](smartFolders) to auto-organize saved items:

**Smart Folder: Recent Web Pages**
- Type: Website
- Created: Last 7 days

**Smart Folder: PDF Documents**
- Type: File System
- URL ends with: .pdf

**Smart Folder: Project Files**
- URL contains: /Projects/

Automatic organization for everything you save.

## Troubleshooting

### Smart Save Not Working in Browser

**Issue:** Pressing ⌘⌃S does nothing in browser

**Solutions:**
- Verify browser is supported (see [Browser Support](browserSupport))
- Check Automation permissions: System Settings → Automation → SupaSidebar → Enable your browser

- Try closing and reopening the browser
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Smart Save Not Working in Finder

**Issue:** Files not being added when pressing ⌘⌃S in Finder

**Solutions:**

- Make sure Finder window is active (frontmost)
- Try selecting files again and pressing ⌘⌃S
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Smart Copy Copies Wrong Content

**Issue:** ⌘⌃C copies file path instead of URL (or vice versa)

**Solutions:**
- Check which app is currently active (frontmost)
- Click the window you want to copy from first
- Then press ⌘⌃C
- Smart Shortcuts detect the active app, not just visible apps

### Permission Denied Error (-1743)

**Issue:** Error message when using shortcuts

**Solutions:**
- Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation

- Try customizing the shortcuts in Preferences → Shortcuts
- Ensure SupaSidebar is running (check menu bar icon)
- Restart SupaSidebar

### Wrong Browser Detected

**Issue:** Smart Save detects wrong browser or fails to detect browser

**Solutions:**
- Make sure the browser window is frontmost (active)
