# Finder Integration

Add files, folders, and applications directly from Finder to your sidebar with keyboard shortcuts - no drag-and-drop required.

## When to Use

- **Quick folder access**: Add frequently used folders (Documents, Downloads, Projects) for instant navigation
- **Project organization**: Organize project directories and files by context
- **App launching**: Add applications for keyboard-driven launching
- **Path extraction**: Save file paths for documentation, terminal, or sharing
- **Desktop decluttering**: Keep reference files accessible without desktop clutter

## How It Works


SupaSidebar uses AppleScript to communicate with Finder, enabling seamless file and folder management:
- Add selected files or folders
- Add the current Finder folder (ignoring selection)
- Copy file paths to clipboard
- All triggered with global keyboard shortcuts

### Context-Aware Smart Shortcuts

**⌘⌃S** and **⌘⌃C** are context-aware shortcuts that adapt automatically:
- **In a browser**: Saves current page OR copies URL
- **In Finder**: Adds selected files/folders OR copies file paths

One shortcut, multiple behaviors based on context.

## Setup

### Required Permissions

Finder integration requires **Automation permissions**:

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**
2. Find **SupaSidebar** in the list
3. Enable the **Finder** checkbox
<br />

  <img src="/assets/automation real.jpeg" alt="Automation Permission" width="800" />
</p>

**First Time:**
When you first use Finder shortcuts, macOS will prompt for permission. Click **OK** to grant access.

## Using Finder Integration

### Add Selected Items (⌘⌃S)

1. Select files or folders in Finder
2. Press **⌘⌃S**
3. Items appear in sidebar immediately

**Multiple Selection:**
Select multiple files/folders → Press **⌘⌃S** → All added at once

<br />
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/saved link.jpeg" alt="Saved File" width="800" />
</p>

**Notification Feedback:**
SupaSidebar shows a notification confirming how many items were added:
- "Added selected item to sidebar" (1 item)
- "Added 5 items to sidebar" (multiple items)

### Add Current Folder (⌘⌥A)

Press **⌘⌥A** to add the folder you're currently viewing in Finder, *ignoring any selected files*.

**Use Case:**
You're browsing through a project folder with files selected, but you want to save the folder itself - press **⌘⌥A**.

### Copy File Paths (⌘⌃C)

When Finder is active, **⌘⌃C** copies file paths instead of URLs:

1. Select files or folders in Finder
2. Press **⌘⌃C**
3. File paths copied to clipboard

**Multiple Selection:**
Selecting multiple items copies all paths, each on a new line:
```
/Users/you/Documents/file1.pdf
/Users/you/Documents/file2.pdf
/Users/you/Downloads/image.png
```

Perfect for documentation, terminal commands, or sharing file locations.

## What You Can Add

- Images and media files
- Code files
- Any file type

Click a file in sidebar → Opens with default application

### Folders

### Applications

3. Press **⌘⌃S** to add them
4. Optionally [pin](pinnedItems) them for ⌘⌥1-9 shortcuts



## Organization

### Folders & Hierarchy

Files and folders can be organized:
- Drag into folders for hierarchical structure
- Create folders within SupaSidebar
- Nest folders for complex project organization

Example structure:
```
📁 Projects
  ├── 📁 Client A
  │   ├── 📄 proposal.pdf
  │   └── 📁 Assets
  ├── 📁 Client B
  └── 📄 template.docx
```

<br />
<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/folder.jpeg" alt="folder" width="800" />
</p>

### Smart Folders for Files

Create [Smart Folders](smartFolders) to auto-organize files:

**Example: Recent PDFs**
- Condition 1: Link type is "File System"
- Condition 2: URL ends with ".pdf"
- Condition 3: Created in last 7 days

All recently added PDFs appear automatically.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃S** | Add selected Finder items to sidebar |
| **⌘⌥A** | Add current Finder folder (ignores selection) |
| **⌘⌃C** | Copy file paths to clipboard |

## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Folder Access
Add frequently accessed folders:
- Downloads folder → Never search for recent downloads
- Documents folder → Instant access to files
- Desktop folder → Quick desktop cleanup

### Project Directory Management
Add all project folders to sidebar:
1. Navigate to ~/Projects in Finder
2. Select all project folders
3. Press **⌘⌃S**
4. Access any project in one click

### Application Launcher
Turn SupaSidebar into an app launcher:
1. Add applications to sidebar
2. Pin frequently used apps
3. Launch with ⌘⌥1-9 shortcuts

Faster than Spotlight for your top 9 apps.

### File Path Workflow
Need file paths for documentation or terminal?
1. Find files in Finder
2. Press **⌘⌃C** to copy paths
3. Paste into documentation, terminal, or scripts

### Temporary File Access
Add files you need for current project:
1. Press **⌘⌃S** to add files
2. Use them throughout the day
3. Delete from sidebar when project is done

No permanent desktop clutter.

### Folder vs. Selection
- **⌘⌃S**: Adds what you've selected (files or folders)
- **⌘⌥A**: Adds the folder you're viewing, ignoring selection

Memorize this distinction for precise control.

## Integration with Other Features

### Combine with Spaces
Create project-specific spaces:
- "Client Work" space → Add client folders and files
- "Personal" space → Add personal documents
- Keep files organized by context

See [Spaces](spaces) for details.

### Use Smart Folders
Auto-collect files by type or date:
- All images added this month

See [Smart Folders](smartFolders) for setup.

### Pin Critical Folders
Pin your most-used folders for instant access:
1. Add folder to sidebar
2. Pin it

See [Pinned Items](pinnedItems) for details.

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission Denied" Error**
- Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
- Enable SupaSidebar for Finder
- Restart SupaSidebar

**Items Not Adding**
- Verify Finder automation permission is granted
- Check that files aren't already in sidebar (duplicates are prevented)
- Try selecting files and pressing ⌘⌃S again

**Wrong Folder Added**
- You pressed ⌘⌥A which adds the *current folder*, not selection
- Use ⌘⌃S to add selected folders instead

**File Paths Not Copying**
- Ensure Finder is the active application
- Press ⌘⌃C while Finder window is focused
- Check System clipboard (paste somewhere to verify)
