# Finder Integration

Add files, folders, and applications directly from Finder to your sidebar with keyboard shortcuts - no drag-and-drop required.

## How It Works


To add a file, folder, or link to the sidebar, follow these steps:

1.  **Choose the file or folder you want to add**  :
Select it in Finder or copy/open the link you want to save.

2.  **Add it using a shortcut**  :
Use the **⌘⌃S** and **⌘⌃C** are context-aware shortcuts that adapt automatically and add the selected file, folder, or link to SupaSidebar.

3.  **Or add it by dragging**  :
Simply drag the file, folder, or link and drop it directly into the sidebar. SupaSidebar will save it immediately.

## Using Finder Integration

### Add Selected Items (⌘⌃S)

1. Select files or folders in Finder
2. Press **⌘⌃S**
3. Items appear in sidebar immediately

**Multiple Selection:**
Select multiple files/folders → Press **⌘⌃S** → All added at once

**Notification Feedback:**
SupaSidebar shows a notification confirming how many items were added:
- "Added selected item to sidebar" (1 item)
- "Added 5 items to sidebar" (multiple items)

### Add Current Folder (⌘⌥A)

Press **⌘⌥A** to add the folder you're currently viewing in Finder, *ignoring any selected files*.

**Use Case:**
You're browsing through a project folder with files selected, but you want to save the folder itself - press **⌘⌥A**.

### Copy File Paths (⌘⌃C)

When Finder is active, **⌘⌃C** copies file paths instead of URLs:

1. Select files or folders in Finder
2. Press **⌘⌃C**
3. File paths copied to clipboard

**Multiple Selection:**
Selecting multiple items copies all paths, each on a new line:
```
/Users/you/Documents/file1.pdf
/Users/you/Documents/file2.pdf
/Users/you/Downloads/image.png
```

Perfect for documentation, terminal commands, or sharing file locations.

## What You Can Add

### Files
- Documents (PDF, Word, Excel, etc.)
- Images and media files
- Code files
- Any file type

Click a file in sidebar → Opens with default application

### Folders
- Project directories
- Downloads folder
- Documents folder
- Any folder on your Mac

Click a folder in sidebar → Opens in Finder


### Folders & Hierarchy

Files and folders can be organized:
- Drag into folders for hierarchical structure
- Create folders within SupaSidebar
- Nest folders for complex project organization

Example structure:
```
📁 Projects
  ├── 📁 Client A
  │   ├── 📄 proposal.pdf
  │   └── 📁 Assets
  ├── 📁 Client B
  └── 📄 template.docx
```

### Smart Folders for Files

Create [Smart Folders](smartFolders) to auto-organize files:

**Example: Recent PDFs**
- Condition 1: Link type is "File System"
- Condition 2: URL ends with ".pdf"
- Condition 3: Created in last 7 days

All recently added PDFs appear automatically.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **⌘⌃S** | Add selected Finder items to sidebar |
| **⌘⌥A** | Add current Finder folder (ignores selection) |
| **⌘⌃C** | Copy file paths to clipboard |

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission Denied" Error**
- Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation
- Enable SupaSidebar for Finder
- Restart SupaSidebar

**Items Not Adding**
- Verify Finder automation permission is granted
- Check that files aren't already in sidebar (duplicates are prevented)
- Try selecting files and pressing ⌘⌃S again

**Wrong Folder Added**
- You pressed ⌘⌥A which adds the *current folder*, not selection
- Use ⌘⌃S to add selected folders instead

**File Paths Not Copying**
- Ensure Finder is the active application
- Press ⌘⌃C while Finder window is focused
- Check System clipboard (paste somewhere to verify)
