# Browser Profiles

Link browser profiles to your spaces for complete session isolation. Each profile has its own cookies, history, and extensions  - switching spaces instantly swaps which profile is visible.

<Callout type="info">
Browser Profiles is a Premium feature that extends [Spaces](/features/spaces). [Upgrade](https://supasidebar.com/pricing) for unlimited spaces with profile linking.

## What are Browser Profiles?

Most browsers let you create multiple profiles  - separate environments with their own bookmarks, history, cookies, and logged-in accounts. For example, you might have a "Work" profile signed into your company accounts and a "Personal" profile for everything else.

SupaSidebar integrates with these browser profiles at the space level. When you link a profile to a space:

- **Live Tabs** show only that profile's tabs
- **Space switching** instantly raises the linked profile's windows and lowers the previous one
- **Browser integration** (Attach, Dock, etc.) targets the profile's window specifically
- **Auto-hide** keeps the sidebar paired with only the profile browser

## Supported Browsers

SupaSidebar automatically discovers profiles from your installed browsers.

| Browser | Profile Discovery |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Brave** | Auto-detected from disk |
| **Chrome** | Auto-detected from disk |
| **Edge** | Auto-detected from disk |
| **Vivaldi** | Auto-detected from disk |
| **Firefox** | Auto-detected from profiles.ini |
| **Zen** | Auto-detected from profiles.ini |
| **Safari** | Detected from system menu |

## Linking a Profile to a Space

1. Open a space in the sidebar
2. In the **Live Tabs** section, click **Link a browser profile**
3. Select a browser and profile from the picker
4. The space now shows only that profile's tabs

Once linked, the Live Tabs header shows the profile name (e.g., "Live Tabs - Brave Work").

## Switching Between Profile Spaces

When you switch from one profile space to another:

1. The **outgoing** profile's browser windows move to the back
2. The **incoming** profile's browser windows come to the front
3. The sidebar re-attaches to the new profile's browser window
4. Live Tabs updates to show only the incoming profile's tabs

This happens instantly  - no tabs are closed or reloaded.

## Auto-Hide Behavior

In profile mode, the sidebar stays paired with its linked browser:

- **Click away** from the profile browser → sidebar automatically hides
- **Toggle sidebar** back on → the profile browser comes to the front alongside it

This prevents the sidebar from blocking other windows when you're not using the linked browser.

## Close Tabs on Space Change

By default, the outgoing profile's browser windows stay open in the background. If you prefer to keep things clean:

1. Open **Preferences**
2. Enable **Close tabs on space change**

When enabled, switching away from a profile space closes that profile's browser windows. Tabs are saved as a snapshot and restored when you return to the space.

<Callout type="warning">
Closed tabs will need to reload when you switch back, which may log you out of some websites. Leave this off if you switch spaces frequently.
</Callout>

## Unlinking a Profile

To remove a profile link from a space:

1. Click the **profile indicator** in the Live Tabs header
2. Select **Unlink**

The space returns to normal mode, showing all browser tabs regardless of profile.

## Tips

- Spaces without a linked profile continue to work exactly as before  - all browser tabs are shown
- If a profile's browser window is not open, the sidebar shows a prompt to launch it
- You can link different browsers to different spaces (e.g., Space 1 → Brave Work, Space 2 → Safari Personal)
- Profile switching works with all [Browser Integration](/features/browserIntegration) modes
