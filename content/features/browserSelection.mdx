# Browser Selection

Choose which browser opens your saved links - assign specific browsers per link, use your active browser dynamically, or pick on demand for ultimate flexibility.


## Quick Start - Three Ways to Select a Browser

### **1. Right‑Click → Open With**
- Right‑click on any link.
- Choose **"Open With…"** from the context menu.
- Pick any installed browser.

### **2. Option‑Click on a Link**
- Hold **Option (⌥)** and click a link.
- Supa Sidebar opens a browser selection popup.
- Choose the browser you want.

### **3. Option + Enter from Command Panel**
- Open the **Command Panel**.
- Select a link or command that involves opening a webpage.
- Press **Option + Enter (⌥ + Return)**.
- Choose the browser from the popup.

> **Note:** The browser selection popup only appears when using shortcuts or modifier keys (Option‑Click, Option‑Enter). Your last used browser may be remembered depending on user settings. All three methods work for **links, tabs, and certain URL‑related commands**.


> Default behavior: If user does nothing, a link opens in its *assigned browser*. If no assignment exists, it opens in the system default browser.
