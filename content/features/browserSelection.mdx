# Browser Selection

Choose which browser opens your saved links - assign specific browsers per link, use your active browser dynamically, or pick on demand for ultimate flexibility.

## When to Use

- **Context-based browsing**: Open work links in Chrome, personal in Safari, dev in Firefox
- **Dynamic workflows**: Use whichever browser you're currently in without manual switching
- **One-time choices**: Pick a browser for a specific session without changing defaults
- **Browser-specific features**: Use browsers that work best for certain sites (Arc for design, Safari for Apple sites)
- **Multi-account management**: Separate work and personal accounts across browsers
- **Testing workflows**: Open same link in different browsers for cross-browser testing
