# Browser Selection

Choose which browser opens your saved links - assign specific browsers per link, use your active browser dynamically, or pick on demand for ultimate flexibility.


## Quick Start - Three Ways to Select a Browser

### **1. Right‑Click → Open With**
- Right‑click on any link.
- Choose **"Open With…"** from the context menu.
- Pick any installed browser.

### **2. Option‑Click on a Link**
- Hold **Option (⌥)** and click a link.
- Supa Sidebar opens a browser selection popup.
- Choose the browser you want.

### **3. Option + Enter from Command Panel**
- Open the **Command Panel**.
- Select a link or command that involves opening a webpage.
- Press **Option + Enter (⌥ + Return)**.
- Choose the browser from the popup.

> **Note:** The browser selection popup only appears when using shortcuts or modifier keys (Option‑Click, Option‑Enter). Your last used browser may be remembered depending on user settings. All three methods work for **links, tabs, and certain URL‑related commands**.


> Default behavior: If user does nothing, a link opens in its *assigned browser*. If no assignment exists, it opens in the system default browser.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `⌥ + Click` — open browser picker (mouse)
- `⌥ + Enter` — open browser picker (keyboard when link selected)
- `⌘ + ⌃ + K` — open command panel
- `↑ / ↓` — navigate browser picker
- `Return` — select browser
- `Esc` — cancel picker

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Per-link assignment**
   - Given a saved link, when I right-click and choose a browser, then that link shows the browser badge and opens in that browser by default.
2. **One-time selection**
   - Given a saved link with an existing assignment, when I hold Option and click the link and choose a different browser, then the link opens in the chosen browser but the assignment remains unchanged.
3. **Active browser mode** (preference)
   - Given "Use active browser" preference enabled, links open in the currently frontmost browser unless they have an explicit per-link assignment.
4. **Picker keyboard accessibility**
   - The picker must be reachable and operable using only keyboard (focus, arrow keys, Return, Esc). Screen reader announces available options.
5. **Unsupported / Not installed browsers**
   - If a browser is not found on the system, it must not be selectable and must appear disabled in the picker.
6. **Edge cases**
   - If the chosen browser fails to open, show a non-blocking error and fallback to the system default browser.
