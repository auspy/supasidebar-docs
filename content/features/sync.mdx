# iCloud Sync

Keep your links, folders, spaces, and tags synchronized across all your Macs using iCloud.

## How It Works

SupaSidebar uses CloudKit to automatically sync your data across devices signed into the same iCloud account. Changes made on one Mac appear on your other Macs within seconds.

### What Syncs

- **Links**: All saved websites, files, and folders
- **Folders**: Your folder structure and organization
- **Spaces**: Workspace configurations and assignments
- **Tags**: Tag names, colors, and descriptions
- **Settings**: Most preferences (excluding device-specific options)

## Setup

iCloud sync is enabled by default when you're signed into iCloud on your Mac.

### Verifying Sync Status

1. Open **Preferences** → **General** tab
2. Look for the **iCloud Sync** status indicator:
   - **Synced**: All data is up to date
   - **Syncing**: Changes are being uploaded or downloaded
   - **Offline**: Not connected to iCloud

### Enabling iCloud for SupaSidebar

If sync isn't working:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Apple ID** → **iCloud**
2. Scroll to **Apps Using iCloud**
3. Ensure **SupaSidebar** is enabled

## Sync Behavior

### Automatic Sync

- Changes sync automatically in the background
- No manual intervention required
- Works even when the app is in the background

### Conflict Resolution

When the same item is edited on multiple devices:
- Most recent change wins
- Deleted items stay deleted across all devices
- New items from other devices appear automatically

### Offline Mode

When offline:
- All your data remains accessible
- Changes are saved locally
- Sync resumes automatically when back online

## Troubleshooting

**Data not appearing on other devices**
- Verify both devices are signed into the same iCloud account
- Check that iCloud Drive is enabled on both devices
- Wait a few minutes - initial sync may take time for large libraries

**Sync status shows "Offline"**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify iCloud is working in System Settings
- Try signing out and back into iCloud

**Duplicate items after sync**
- This can happen after reinstalling the app
- Delete duplicates manually - the deletion will sync

**Sync is slow**
- Large libraries take longer to sync initially
- Ensure you have sufficient iCloud storage
- Check iCloud status at apple.com/support/systemstatus

## Privacy & Data

- All data is stored in your private iCloud container
- SupaSidebar cannot access your data - only you can
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Deleting the app does not delete your iCloud data

### Deleting Synced Data

To remove all synced data:

1. Delete SupaSidebar from all devices
2. Open **System Settings** → **Apple ID** → **iCloud** → **Manage Storage**
3. Find and delete SupaSidebar data
